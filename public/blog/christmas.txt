I pray the Lord for he to thank;
I won the lawsuit against the bank.
Thou giveth a job which hath giveth me food
Puts me in a pleasant mood.
Yet flecked some beggars on London’s lane,
So I hit them hard with my cane.
Wilt thou exterminate these useless scum,
They do nothing except hum.
I beg thy Lord to kill the poor
Just the talk of welfare makes me snore.

O those retardant perspective of donors:
The money for panhandlers
And nothing for landowners.
Entered my shop a stupid charity,
Followed by my fist in such velocity.
Please, Lord, I beg thou dearly
Kill the misguided and suffer them cruelly.

I ponder over my friend Marley’s face,
It appeared on my door today and set my heart to race.
May that Jacob Marley be tended in Heaven.
When did he die? October fifth, or December eleven?

Then my stupid nephew, Fred —
O how I wish he is dead.
He entered my shop with drunken vigor,
Crying, “Uncle, uncle — try this liquor.”
I kicked him out with my boot
And resumed counting all my loot.
No sooner a second past,
The humbug came back in so fast,
As if to play some game.
“You’re poor enough!” I snapped.
“You’re rich enough!” He clapped.
I yelled and swore at that miserable fool
Until he left with a laugh and my flying footstool.

Afterwards, my clerk, that Bob Cratchit,
His senseless joy inspires me
To abuse him with a hatchet.

Yet I ponder over my ex-fiancée Belle,
We broke up years ago,
And she can go to Hell.

In this godforsaken weather delight us with depression,
More blissful blizzards to blockade transportation.

I hate this world
I hate this time
I hate Christmas
I hate this rhyme!

Yet my true loves — penny, shilling, pound
Doth make the world go round.
I need more to spend my living.
After all, Christmas is a time for giving.

And if I die before I wake
I request one thing for my sake.
So no one wilt claim ‘em…
Burn my money…
Amen.
