When you approach any political / ethical question, you have to start from the foundation that your opponent is trying to do something that they think is a moral good. 99% of people are good and decent people.

When faced with a person, ideology, or system that you dislike, instead of analyzing it and figuring out what you don’t like about it and move on from there, the natural inclination is to do the exact opposite of what that idea is.

Our brain is not a reliable observer or narrator. It has so many different biases that affect the type of memories you form, the things you remember when you research, the things you look for when you research. There are two checks you could perform to ensure you’re not in an epistemic bubble: know the best argument against your stance, and know what would change your mind on your stance. Brains might be biased by nature, but you can detect bias by nuture.

People’s feelings can be irrational sometimes, but they are never random. Even trauma responses are based on a particular stimuli that someone was exposed to earlier to life.

There is a specific reason why they believe in what they believe. It’s our job to find that out to convince them otherwise.

You can’t change the world, but you can change your world. The most we can do is to establish the locus of control with us and to not externalize that. Do everything to maximize your happiness; a happy foundation of a person is going to be better able to deal with and change and impart their values on the world.
